INSTALLATION
============
Download and extract the archive, and run the following command as root to
install the plugin:

> python setup.py install

Next, open Gedit and activate the plugin through Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins.
The plugin is called 'IPython'

USAGE
=====
Open a terminal and start an IPython console with the following command:

> ipython-listener

This is a simple wrapper around a regular IPython console that listens for
incoming signals from the Gedit plugin. Next you can run selected text in
the IPython console through Tools -> Run in IPython or by pressing Control+R.
If no text is selected, the entire document will be executed.
